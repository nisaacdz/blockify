Define your resource model: Identify the resources that you want to expose through your API, such as blocks, transactions, and network information.

Design your resource URLs: Design a set of resource URLs that correspond to each resource. For example, you could use /blocks to retrieve all blocks and /blocks/{block_id} to retrieve a specific block.

Map HTTP methods to actions: Map the standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to actions that your server will take when clients interact with your API. For example, a GET request to /blocks could retrieve all blocks, while a POST request to /transactions could submit a new transaction.

Use HTTP status codes: Use HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of each request. For example, use a 200 status code to indicate success, a 404 status code to indicate a resource was not found, and a 500 status code to indicate an internal server error.

Use JSON as the response format: Use JSON as the format for responses to client requests. JSON is a common format that is widely supported by programming languages.

Implement your REST API: Use your chosen Rust framework to implement your REST API using the resource URLs and HTTP methods you have defined.

Test your API: Test your API to ensure that it is functioning correctly and can handle the expected load.

Document your API: Document your API to make it easy for clients to understand how to use it. Include information such as resource URLs, HTTP methods, expected request and response formats, and error codes.
